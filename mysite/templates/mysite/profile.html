                   			<p> I spent 5 years in the most beautiful univesity in China. I was honored  to have opportunity studing and do research in one of the best university in China. My major is physics. Most of the time, I was dealing with experimenal facilities and analysing data using the powerful scientific software framework developed by CERN.

                                    <p> Supporting by CSC(Chinese Scholarship Counile) I visited National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory which is the premier radioactive beam facility in the United States. They are the worldâ€™s leaders in research areas to probe the density dependence of symmetry energy using heavy ion collisions on which my thesis also focus.

                                    During my study in MSU, I focused on three projects and join the other two with limited defined tasks. First, I will undertake the data analysis of the Sn+Sn data at E/A=70 MeV. The experiment is very important for the precision measurement of isospin diffusion. The experimental equipment consists of the MSU Miniball, the LASSA silicon strip detector array, and the S800 spectrometer.
